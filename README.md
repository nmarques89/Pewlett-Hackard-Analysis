# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project was to act as a Human Resources Analyst to determine who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions (and titles) will Pewlett Hackard need to fill.

## Results
1. Over 90 thousand Employees are eligible for retirement.
2. From the Unique Titles file we can see that the bulk of future retirees, upwards of 63%, are classified as senior staff.

3. After creating the mentorship table I found that there were 1,549 employees eligible.
4. In short, this "Grey Wave" will result in a significant period of transition for Pewlett Hackard

## Summary 
Conisdering only 1,549 members are eligible for mentorship it would seem that there will not only be a massive transitional phase but that this phase will also result in a significant deficit in senior positions.
